# Finger-Muscle-Detection-and-Rehabilitation-for-people-with-stroke
This project proposes an innovative approach to continuous finger tracking, integrating Google’s
MediaPipe Hand with 3D Depth camera technology. The system develops software capable
of measuring finger joint angles over extended periods, enabling comparative analysis of hand
capabilities across individuals. Designed to benefit those with hand disabilities, the software
incorporates games controlled by finger movement, enhancing both the measurement and reha-
bilitation processes through engagement.

The primary goal of this project is to aid in the current diagnosis and treatment of hand-
related disorders. By facilitating more convenient and efficient collection of finger movement
datasets, healthcare professionals and therapists can gain quick and straightforward insights into
their patients’ hand patterns. This allows for the tailoring of better rehabilitation methods for
individuals at a lower cost of time and money.

Furthermore, the results of this project can potentially contribute to other fields of industry
related to hand-software interaction, such as the gaming industry and online AR/VR shopping.
This provides more alternative ways of interaction, potentially expanding the scope of assistive
technologies beyond traditional medical applications.
